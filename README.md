#StringConcatMythTest 

When concatenating strings it was always recommended to use String buffer, then later String Builder. I also did the same whenever i
needed to but after watching a video by Dr. Venkat Subramaniam now i would check how the compiler internally does before using builder 
or buffer. 
Please take a look at the StringConcatMythTest.java file and check the class file for the same java compiler internally uses a 
String builder for concatenation.
